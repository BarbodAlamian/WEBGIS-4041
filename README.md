# 🌍 Git Learning Repository for GIS Students

Welcome to my Git learning repository! This repo was created to practice and master version control skills specifically tailored for GIS workflows.

## 📚 About This Repository

As a GIS student, I'm using this repository to:
- Learn Git fundamentals and version control
- Practice managing spatial data projects
- Understand collaborative workflows in geospatial development
- Build good habits for reproducible research and data management

## 🛠️ GIS & Geospatial Tools Used

- **QGIS** - Desktop GIS applications
- **Python** with geospatial libraries:
  - `geopandas` - Spatial data manipulation
  - `rasterio` - Raster data processing
  - `folium` - Interactive web maps
  - `matplotlib`, `plotly` - Data visualization
- **GDAL/OGR** - Command-line spatial data processing
- **PostGIS** - Spatial database operations (if applicable)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### Git Fundamentals
- [ ] Basic commands (`git add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`)
- [ ] Branching and merging strategies
- [ ] Resolving conflicts in spatial data
- [ ] Working with `.gitignore` for large spatial files

### GIS-Specific Version Control
- [ ] Managing large spatial datasets with Git LFS
- [ ] Version control for GIS project files (.qgz, .mxd)
- [ ] Handling coordinate reference systems in collaborative work
- [ ] Reproducible spatial analysis workflows

### Collaborative Workflows
- [ ] GitHub/GitLab collaboration patterns
- [ ] Code review for spatial analysis scripts
- [ ] Documentation best practices for spatial projects
- [ ] Issue tracking and project management
